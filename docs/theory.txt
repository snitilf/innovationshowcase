The Global Trust Engine: The Creation of a ML4DI (Machine Learning for Development
Integrity) Model Capable of Detecting and Combatting Fraud in the Development Arena
Theoretical Framework
Defining Corruption
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) defines corruption as the “misuse of
entrusted power for private gain” (UNDP, 2008, pg. 7). Corruption operates across both private
and public sectors, taking forms such as bribery, fraud, and extortion (UNDP, 2008, pg. 7). In the
context of foreign aid and development, corruption is undertaken by bureaucratic officials who
exploit their power in order to “further their own interests”, often diverting funds intended for
social programs, infrastructure projects, or economic development into their political and
personal pockets (Blackburn et al., 2006, pg. 2448). Former United Nations Secretary-General
Ban Ki-Moon explained that roughly 30% of development funds or foreign aid is “devour[ed]”
by corruption before reaching the recipient country (Quibiria, 2017, pg. 10). Thus, corruption is
not just a financial crime; it is fundamentally a governance issue rooted in structural weaknesses.
Causes of Corruption
The UNDP outlines several factors that contribute to widespread corruption, indicating that
corruption “thrives” in environments with limited accountability, powerful monopolies, and poor
government transparency (UNDP, 2008, pg. 5). Furthermore, the UNDP points to underlying
systemic causes such as low public-sector wages, weak enforcement systems, as well as
“institutional weaknesses in the legislative and judicial systems” (UNDP, 2008, pg. 10). These
structural conditions, combined with low corruption detection rates, foster an environment where
the rewards of corruption outweigh the risks, enabling recipient countries to become “effective
breeding grounds” for corrupt practices (UNDP, 2008, pg. 10).
Money Laundering
One of the main mechanisms by which corruption occurs is through money-laundering.
Money-laundering is the process by which “the proceeds of crime are run through the financial
system to disguise their illegal origins and make them appear to be legitimate funds” (Scott,
1995, pg. 1). To conceal the illicit nature of these funds, launderers will “merge their illegal
cash” into legitimate financial channels such as a “legal business, bank, or real estate” (UNODC,
n.d.). Money-laundering occurs in three distinct stages, each designed to further obscure the
origin of the illegal funds. First is the placement stage, which involves severing the money from
its “direct association with the crime” (UNODC, n.d.). Next is the layering stage, in which the
trail of the funds is “disguis[ed]” (UNODC, n.d.). Last is the integration stage, where the money
becomes available to the criminal from the seemingly legitimate sources (UNODC, n.d.).
Effects of Corruption
The effects of corruption are detrimental to the already unstable countries which are most
impacted. Perhaps the most visible consequences of corruption are economic: corruption diverts
valuable funds and resources away from “growth-promoting areas” such as health, education,
and infrastructure investment; these funds are instead put towards the personal interests of those
in power (Blackburn et al., pg. 2449). As a result, corruption makes these countries less
appealing destinations for private investment, further weakening markets and limiting job
opportunities (Diagana & Diagne, 2023). In addition, corruption produces significant social and
political consequences: the UNDP explains that corruption “undermines the rule of law” leading
to the “violation of human rights” and the establishment of “an anti-democratic environment”
(UNDP, 2008, pg. 6). By diverting development funds, corruption “undermin[es] a government’s
ability to provide basic services”, therefore perpetuating inequalities and injustices (UNDP, 2008,
pg. 5).
The Vicious Cycle of Corruption
The persistence of corruption can be understood as cyclical: corruption both causes and results
from weak institutions, poverty, and inequality; this creates a self-reinforcing vicious cycle that
is difficult to break. In countries with limited governance, high inequality, widespread poverty,
and “perverse economic incentives”, individuals may turn to corruption in order to feed their
families (UNDP, 2015, pg. 16). Consequently, the country’s institutions and government are
undermined through the diversion of resources away from infrastructure and social services.
With already weak oversight and limited accountability, corrupt practices become normalized
(Blackburn et al., 2006, pg. 2449). As corruption continues, inequality worsens, economic
growth slows, and citizens may feel compelled to engage in corrupt practices to survive, thus
feeding back into the system.
Economic Necessity
The use of Machine Learning is urgent and necessary for the intervention of fraudulent activity
and corruption (Odufisan, Abhulimen, & Ogunti, 2025).Traditional methods have become
inefficient and inadequate; they struggle with complexity, behavioral factors, large scale real time
data and rely on historical data (Zhang, Lecture 2025). These systems empower and train
machines to learn large and complex data sets, analyze algorithms and recognize patterns.
Machine learning models perform in universal ways in different sectors of the economy. For
example, banking and finance through analyzing customer behaviour and spending patterns,
money laundering schemes (Hassan et al., 2023), e-commerce through analyzing purchase
histories, detecting IP addresses and fraudulent merchants (Paul and Nikolaev, 2021), healthcare
through flagging identity theft, medical and billing data, patient records (Kasaraneni, 2024),
education through academic integrity, plagiarism, cheating, admission fraud (Odufisan,
Abhulimen, & Ogunti, 2025). Machine learning models have the power to work in real-time,
monitoring trades, transfers and financial flows while analyzing datasets to flag any suspicious
activity before they can cause serious harm. These systems are able to create risk assessment
models by being trained per piece of data to alert of any sign of suspicion. Machine learning
models work on improving performance beyond what traditional models can handle in order to
create secure, accurate and effective financial environments.
Relevance
This approach has become extremely relevant within the world we live in today. E-Finance and
AI are the future as financial development is becoming more and more digitalized. As a society,
we must adapt and innovate to maintain secure, accurate and effective environments (Zhang,
Lecture 2025). Human oversight alone cannot process millions of transactions per second;
consequently, billions of dollars are lost annually to corruption, fraud, and embezzlement across
sectors. As financial markets, digital currencies, and electronic payment systems expand
globally, the potential for misuse increases (Zhang, Lecture 2025). Our Global Trust Engine’s
mission is to address this issue at hand by using a data-driven mechanism to assess risk in real
time, specifically for developing economies where fraudulent activity and corruption are able to
destabilize the economy at a large scale. As technology evolves, there is an urgency for stricter
regulations and the tightening of traditional mechanisms, where these systems can support our
primary institutions. Machine Learning can prevent large-scale financial losses and prioritize
security of all parties involved. Risk assessment is crucial as more and more sectors are
becoming vulnerable to manipulation. Machine Learning promotes financial integrity and
strengthens the credibility and transparency of both domestic and international institutions, so
nothing can be done under the radar without being flagged.
Policy Implications
Machine Learning Systems are always learning and therefore always improving to perform
real-time analysis, reduce inaccuracies and false positives and identify immediate anomalies in
data that humans may miss (Bansal et al., 2024). The innovation of these models create a secure
and more trustworthy digital environment, improve the accuracy of predictions, advance
sustainable economic growth and promote financial stability within institutions (Desai, 2023).
Additionally, machine learning models empower the use of digitalization (Odufisan, Abhulimen,
& Ogunti, 2025). The Global Trust Engine reinforces the credibility of machine learning
mechanisms for risk assessment and financial transparency. The findings confirm that
measurable governance indicators can reliably signal early signs of financial and political
vulnerability, underscoring the model’s potential as a proactive policy tool. Moving forward,
institutions can adopt these measures to identify high risk environments and develop proper
safeguards to combat corruption accurately through anomaly detection, risk analysis and text
analysis. However, we acknowledge that our model cannot capture some of the non-quantifiable
factors that play a role in reducing governance like historical data and legacies that shape
corruption and fraudulent patterns.
Case Study Analysis: Quantitative and Qualitative Instruments
Mozambique
The Hidden Debt Crisis in Mozambique was a product of the illicit use of $2 billion USD
in loans on behalf of Mozambican officials. The initial flows of these funds are described by the
transfer of $2 billion USD to three state-owned companies in Mozambique from a Russian and
Swiss Bank (CHR Michelsen Institute, 2021, 16). The loans were offered to Mozambican
enterprises for the sake of developing maritime security and empowering the fishing industry, a
goal ultimately poisoned by the diversion of these funds to corrupt government officials who
stole them for their own benefit and private investment. The primary organizer of the scheme,
former Mozambican Finance Minister, Manuel Chang, received an additional $7 million USD in
bribes to help facilitate the relocation of the funds (U.S. Department of Justice, 2024). These
funds were laundered upon their integration into the formal economy, as they were funneled
through sales to defrauded foreign investors from the United States. He illegally diverted more
than $200 million USD of the development funds into private pockets for personal benefit,
ultimately leading to his conviction in the United States in 2024 (U.S. Department of Justice,
2024). The laundering scheme and procedure for theft collapsed as state-owned companies
defaulted on over $700 million USD in loans. From the case of Mozambique, we observe a series
of quantitative and qualitative patterns that are listed in Table 1 which serve the capacity to train
a Machine Learning model to detect and prevent such corruption in the future.
Malaysia
The 1MDb development bank in Malaysia was initially a state fund chaired by former
Prime Minister Najib Razak. The fund served the purpose of empowering Malaysia’s economic
growth through foreign direct investment (FDI) and global partnerships. These goals remained
unmaterialized due to the theft of $4.5 billion USD, orchestrated by several Malaysian
government officials, most notably the former Prime Minister Razak (The Guardian, 2020). The
funds were diverted toward a series of extravagant investments including luxury homes and
properties in Beverly Hills, New York, and London, alongside a superyacht and fine art by
Monet and Van Gogh (US Department of Justice, 2024)). With complicity from a series of global
banks, Razak was able to siphon stolen funds through accounts internationally and conceal the
illegal procedures through which he illegally obtained the funds. The magnitude of this
corruption can be observed through Malaysia’s relatively low scores on governance indicators
and measures of corruption as listed in Table 1. Similarly to Mozambique, these instruments for
measuring corruption allow us to develop a Machine Learning model capable of detecting
quantitative and qualitative patterns that commonly arise among cases of corruption, allowing us
to prevent a future catastrophe that may similarly exploit the development of marginalized
population for the expansion of the wealth of economic elite like Razak

Figure 7: Distribution of Countries by Risk Category. This pie chart shows the composition of our 19-country dataset by
descriptive risk category: 42.1% Low-Risk (8 countries), 36.8% High-Risk (7 countries), and 21.1% Medium-Risk (4 countries).
This balanced distribution provides adequate representation for model training.
Figure 8: Corruption Risk Labels by Country and Year (All 19 Countries). This heatmap is the primary result, showing the
binary corruption_risk labels for all 266 country-year observations. Red cells (1) indicate High Risk (4+ flags), while green cells
(0) indicate Low Risk (<4 flags). Countries are sorted by risk, showing 11 nations with consistent high-risk patterns (red) and 8
with low-risk status (green). These labels serve as the final training data for our model.
Next Step: Model Training and Deployment
A crucial next step involves incorporating qualitative data to enrich the model's
predictive power. As outlined in the proposal, we will perform sentiment analysis on
corruption-related news headlines for the countries in our dataset. Utilizing Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tools such as TextBlob or VADER, sentiment scores will be extracted and
integrated as an additional predictive feature. This will test the hypothesis that shifts in public
sentiment, as reflected in media coverage, can serve as an early qualitative warning sign
alongside quantitative governance indicators.
The expanded and labeled corruption_data_expanded_labeled.csv dataset will be systematically
divided into training and testing sets. A Decision Tree Classifier, chosen for its interpretability
and robust performance on structured data, will be trained on the combined set of governance
and economic indicators (and subsequently, sentiment scores). The model's performance will
then be rigorously evaluated using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall to ensure
its reliability in identifying high-risk environments.
A core deliverable for this phase will be the visualization of the trained Decision Tree. This
graphical representation will provide a clear, intuitive flowchart of the model's decision-making
process, illustrating precisely how different indicator thresholds lead to a "corruption risk"
classification. Such transparency is vital for stakeholder understanding and trust in an early
warning system designed for development integrity.
The successful completion of these remaining steps will bring the Global Trust Engine to
fruition, providing a powerful, data-driven tool to proactively combat corruption and safeguard
international development efforts.
